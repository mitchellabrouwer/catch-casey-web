Casey is clever, quick, and loose in your neighbourhood! Get outside, explore, and become a detective in this geo-powered AR game full of facts and mysteries!

CATCH CASEY
An interactive, educational AR adventure where kids become detectives in their own neighborhood.

Casey is clever. Casey is quick. And Casey has left a trail of clues across your area — hidden in the real world.
Catch Casey turns your surroundings into a geo-powered, AR-driven learning game where kids become detectives, track down hideouts, and recall what they’ve learned to move closer to catching the mysterious Casey.

WHAT KIDS WILL LEARN
• Math, from shapes to equations
• Science, like animals, space, and chemistry
• Geography, including rivers, climates, and ecosystems
• History, from ancient times to modern discoveries

HOW IT WORKS
• Read short “case notes” on educational topics
• Use your device to explore in AR and find hideouts
• Recall what you’ve learned to collect clues and earn badges
• Choose how far hideouts can appear from home — walk, ride, or drive to them
• Progress from Easy to Hard clues — designed for ages 4 to 12
• Track your detective progress on your dashboard

FOR GROWN-UPS
• AR mode is required — adult supervision is recommended
• Location data is used only within the app to power gameplay
• No personal data is collected — everything is saved locally on your device
• No ads, no in-app purchases, and no marketing of any kind
• Please note: GPS usage can increase battery drain

CAN YOU SOLVE THE CASE?
Put on your detective badge, follow the clues, and get ready to learn something new while chasing one of the most elusive explorers of all time.
